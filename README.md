# README

To get this application started you need to follow each README of the following folders:

Hint: I highly advise to use the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installation method.

1. [Node.js API](api/node/README.md)
2. [Python API](api/python/README.md)
3. [Browser extension](apps/browser_extension/README.md)
4. [Dashboard](apps/dashboard/README.md)

Once you have done that you can start the application using the following commands:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

This will start all applications in docker.
If you only want to start certain ones just check the top-level package.json file.
